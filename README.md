# Time-Series-Forecasting

# What is Time Series Forecasting?

#Time series forecasting involves predicting future values of a variable based on its historical data. This technique is widely used in various domains, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and sales analysis.

#Key Components of Time Series Forecasting:

#Time Series Data: This is the core data type used in time series forecasting. It consists of a sequence of observations collected at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
#Trend: This is the long-term direction of the time series (upward, downward, or stationary).
#Seasonality: This is a recurring pattern in the data that repeats over a fixed period (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly).
#Noise: This is the random fluctuations in the data that cannot be explained by trend or seasonality.
# Types of Time Series Forecasting Models:

# Statistical Models:
1.ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A popular statistical model that combines autoregressive, integrated, and moving average components to capture trend, seasonality, and noise.
2.SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): An extension of ARIMA that explicitly models seasonality.
#Exponential Smoothing: A family of statistical methods that assign exponentially decreasing weights to older observations.
#Machine Learning Models:
1.Neural Networks: Deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be used to capture complex patterns in time series data.
2.Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVMs can be used for time series classification and regression tasks.
3.Random Forests: Ensemble models like Random Forests can be applied to time series forecasting.
